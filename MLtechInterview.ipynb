    "\n",
    "In this challenge, you will showcase your knowledge in feature engineering, dimensionality reduction, model selection and evaluation, hyperparameter tuning, and any other techniques of machine learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "There isn't a correct solution to this challenge. All we would like to learn is your thinking process that demonstrates your knowledge, experience, and creativity in developing machine learning models. Therefore, in addition to developing the model and optimizing its performance, you should also elaborate your thinking process and justify your decisions thoughout the iterative problem-solving process.\n",
    "\n",
    "The suggested time to spend on this challenge is 90-120 minutes. If you don't have time to finish all the tasks you plan to do, simply document the to-dos at the end of your response.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Instructions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Download the housing prices data set (housing_prices.csv). The data is big enough to showcase your thoughts but not so that processing power will be a problem.\n",
    "- Using Python, analyze the features and determine which feature set to select for modeling.\n",
    "- Train and cross validate several regression models, attempting to accurately predict the SalePrice target variable.\n",
    "- Evaluate all models and show comparison of performance metrics.\n",
    "- State your thoughts on model performance, which model(s) you would select, and why.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Deliverables Checklist:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python code.\n",
    "- Your thinking process.\n",
    "- The features selected for machine learning.\n",
    "- The results (e.g., performance metrics) of your selected model(s)."
